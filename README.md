# 🧠 Depression and Exercise Prediction 🏋️‍♀️

This project analyzes the relationship between exercise habits and depression levels using data from Kaggle. The goal is to build a machine learning model that predicts depression based on physical activity and other health-related features.

## 📊 Dataset

- Source: [Kaggle - Depression and Exercise](https://www.kaggle.com/) *(insert link to dataset here)*
- Includes features like:
  - Physical activity levels
  - Sleep habits
  - Demographics
  - Reported depression symptoms

## ⚙️ Project Steps

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Removed missing values  
   - Categorical encoding  
   - Feature scaling

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Correlation analysis  
   - Distribution plots  

3. **Modeling**  
   - Models used: `Logistic Regression`, `Random Forest`, `XGBoost`  
   - Evaluated with metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score

4. **Best Result**  
   - Model: Random Forest  
   - Accuracy: **XX%** *(fill your score here)*
